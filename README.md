What I need to install: inquirer fs-extra path sharp

I downloaded ffmpeg in order to convert videos and audios with node 

I made ffmpeg a system variable by placing the extracted zip-file in C: and then make a new variable in control panels envirment variables

Users cannot use sharp, ffmpeg, fs, child_process in browser because of security reason, therefor I need to make an Electron app.
